```

### Try without installing

## Included extensions

### 1. `sessions.ts`

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3f7dc9a-01f3-4db1-867b-5b02d16f2e91

Browse recent Pi sessions, insert `@@` references, and resolve them with a `read_session` tool.

**Recent build context**
- Added in the last week with session mention support for browsing recent sessions, inserting `@S` references, and forcing referenced sessions to be read before answering.
- Tuned to avoid startup session scans until the feature is actually used.

**What it does**
- `/mention` command to insert a session reference
- `@@` picker UI in the TUI editor
- `read_session` tool to summarize a referenced session via a separate Pi process
- input transform that reminds the agent to resolve `@S-...` references first

**Config file**
- Path: `~/.pi/agent/sessions.json`
- Example:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "provider": "openai-codex",
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "thinking": "off"
  }
}
```

### 2. `pi-as-subagent.ts`

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4015c51-8a52-4f0b-af49-45f15ee9170e

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6bd26ce-f37c-4f55-92bb-7a9f48f62aa1

Adds configurable Pi subagents with `@#name` autocomplete and an `ask_pi_subagent` tool.

**Recent build context**
- Added in the last week as a Pi-backed subagent extension with default Oracle config.
- Hardened with stdin task passing, temp-file system prompts, timeout/output/abort safeguards.
- Refined the status line formatting and tightened autocomplete display spacing.

**What it does**
- `@#oracle`-style autocomplete
- `ask_pi_subagent` tool for second opinions and review flows
- first-run default config generation
- per-subagent provider/model/thinking/timeout settings

**Config file**
- Path: `~/.pi/agent/pi-as-subagent.json`
- Example:

```json
{
  "oracle": {
    "description": "Read-only second opinion for debugging, code review, and architecture questions.",
    "system_prompt": "You are Oracle, a read-only second-opinion subagent. Help debug, review code, and reason about architecture when explicitly asked. Truth-seek: report only evidence-backed findings in concise Markdown, cite file paths, commands, logs, or links where relevant, distinguish facts from hypotheses, and state uncertainty. Do not modify files, run destructive actions, hallucinate, or fabricate information.",
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "provider": "openai-codex",
    "thinking": "medium",
    "timeout_seconds": 300
  }
}
```

### 3. `smart-titlebar.ts`

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3f7dc9a-01f3-4db1-867b-5b02d16f2e91

_NOTE: Shared demo with "session mentions". See title bar_

Generates short session titles and animates the terminal title while Pi is working.

**Recent build context**
- Renamed in the last week from an older title extension to better reflect both generated titles and the titlebar spinner.
- Updated with a neutral `π` fallback instead of leaving `π - Working` behind after activity.
- Added configurable low-cost title generation defaults.

**What it does**
- animated terminal title spinner during active agent work
- auto-generated session name from the first user prompt and first assistant result
- neutral fallback title when no title has been set yet

**Config file**
- Path: `~/.pi/agent/smart-titlebar.json`
- Example:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai-codex",
  "model": "gpt-5.5",
  "thinking": "off"
}
```

### 4. `zed-bell.ts`

Rings the terminal bell when Pi finishes a turn.

**Recent build context**
- Present in the current extension set as a tiny completion notifier.

**What it does**
- emits `\x07` on `agent_end`
- useful for long-running prompts when Pi is in another tab or split

**Config file**
- No config file required.
